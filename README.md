# podman

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/podman.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/podman)

A client library for [podman](https://podman.io)

## Overview and scope

At a high level, the scope of podman-haskell is to provides a REST client for the new podman API based on the swagger description.
The goal is to validate the definitions and enable using the service in Haskell application.

For compat API, use the [docker client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/docker) instead.

## Features

- JSON decoder for API endpoints.
- HTTP client helper functions.

## Contribute

Contributions are most welcome, for example the project needs help to:

- Add missing endpoint (e.g. Pod, Image).
- Add test case json sample.
- Report and fix mismatchs in the upstream podman swagger documentation.
- Higher level functions to simplify usage.

To work on this project you need an Haskell toolchain, for example on fedora 33:

```
$ sudo dnf install -y ghc cabal-install && cabal update
```

Then grab a copy of the swagger file:

```
$ curl -OL https://storage.googleapis.com/libpod-master-releases/swagger-latest.yaml
```

Run tests:

```
$ cabal build --enable-tests --enable-benchmarks --write-ghc-environment-files=always -O0 all
$ cabal test --enable-tests --test-show-details=direct -O0
$ cabal haddock
```

Update the types by running the `podman-codegen` utility.

Validate the API using the `podman-quickcheck` and the `podman-demo` utility.
